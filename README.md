# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios
```

#### Running on iOS Simulator

To specifically target the iOS simulator and avoid device provisioning issues, use these commands:

```sh
# Run in iPhone 16 Pro simulator (with Metro bundler)
npm run ios:sim

# Run in iPhone 16 Pro simulator (without Metro bundler)
npm run ios:sim:no-packager
```

These commands were added to handle common provisioning profile issues when running on simulators. Use `ios:sim` for normal development, and `ios:sim:no-packager` when you already have the Metro bundler running in another terminal.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Location Services

### Current Implementation

The app **already includes full location services** with dynamic GPS-based weather fetching:

- **Dynamic Location**: Uses `react-native-geolocation-service` to get user's current coordinates
- **Permission Handling**: Automatic permission requests for iOS and Android
- **Fallback Location**: Copenhagen, Denmark for iOS simulator during development
- **Weather Integration**: Weather data fetched based on user's actual GPS location

### Location Configuration

**Default Behavior:**
- App requests location permissions on first launch
- Weather data is fetched for user's current GPS location
- Location is labeled as "Current Location" in the UI

**Development Mode:**
- iOS Simulator uses Copenhagen coordinates (55.6761, 12.5683) as fallback
- Real devices use actual GPS coordinates
- Android emulator requires location simulation in AVD settings

**To Use Manual Location Instead:**

If you want to switch to hardcoded location for testing:

1. Open `src/services/locationService.ts`
2. Modify the `getCurrentLocation` function to always return hardcoded coordinates:

```typescript
export const getCurrentLocation = async (): Promise<LocationCoordinates> => {
  // Always use hardcoded location (Stockholm example)
  return Promise.resolve({
    latitude: 59.3293,
    longitude: 18.0686,
  });
};
```

**Location Permissions:**
- iOS: Location access requested automatically via `Geolocation.requestAuthorization()`
- Android: Uses `PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`
- Both platforms show appropriate permission dialogs

For comprehensive enhancement plans, see [WEATHER_APP_ENHANCEMENTS.md](./WEATHER_APP_ENHANCEMENTS.md).

## Environment Setup

### Environment Variables

HostAway requires specific environment variables to function properly. The app uses different environment configurations based on build type:

#### Environment Files

- `.env` - Base environment file for local development
- `.env.development` - Used for development builds
- `.env.production` - Used for production builds
- `.env.test` - Used when running tests

All environment files should contain the same variables with appropriate values for each environment.

#### Required Environment Variables

| Variable              | Description                         | Example                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` | API key for the OpenWeather service | `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0`           |
| `OPENWEATHER_API_URL` | Base URL for OpenWeather API        | `https://api.openweathermap.org` |

#### Setting Up Environment Files

1. Copy the example environment file to create your base configuration:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your API credentials:

   ```
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   OPENWEATHER_API_URL=https://api.openweathermap.org
   ```

3. For different build environments, create copies with appropriate configurations:

   ```bash
   cp .env .env.development
   cp .env .env.production
   cp .env .env.test
   ```

4. Modify each file as needed for its specific environment.

### Getting an OpenWeather API Key

1. Sign up at [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Navigate to your account page and find the "API keys" tab
3. Generate a new API key (or use the default one provided)
4. Copy the key and paste it in your environment files
5. Note that new API keys may take a few hours to activate

import WeatherCard from '../src/components/WeatherCard';

describe('WeatherCard', () => {
  it('displays weather information correctly', () => {
    const props = {
      temperature: 20,
      condition: 'Sunny',
      location: 'Stockholm',
    };

    const {getByText} = render(<WeatherCard {...props} />);

    expect(getByText('20°')).toBeTruthy();
    expect(getByText('Sunny')).toBeTruthy();
    expect(getByText('Stockholm')).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

#### Redux Testing

```typescript
import weatherReducer, {setWeather} from '../src/store/slices/weatherSlice';

describe('Weather Slice', () => {
  it('should handle initial state', () => {
    expect(weatherReducer(undefined, {type: 'unknown'})).toEqual({
      current: null,
      forecast: [],
      loading: false,
      error: null,
    });
  });
});
```

## Project-Specific Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Location Services

If location services aren't working:

1. Check permissions in device settings
2. Ensure location services are enabled
3. Verify your app has the correct permissions in the manifest/info.plist
4. For Android, verify Google Play Services is installed and up to date

#### Weather API Issues

If weather data isn't loading:

1. Verify your API key in `.env`
2. Check your network connection
3. Confirm you haven't exceeded API rate limits
4. Check the API response in the network tab

#### Redux Persistence

If state isn't persisting:

1. Clear AsyncStorage:

```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
await AsyncStorage.clear();
```

2. Reset the Redux store:

```javascript
dispatch({type: 'RESET_STORE'});
```

#### Performance Issues

If experiencing slow performance:

1. Enable performance monitoring in development
2. Check image sizes and implement proper caching
3. Use Redux selectors efficiently
4. Implement proper list virtualization

#### Build Process

For native build issues:

1. Clean build folders:

```bash
# iOS
cd ios && xcodebuild clean
pod deintegrate
pod install

# Android
cd android && ./gradlew clean
```

2. Reset Metro cache:

```bash
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

3. Clear npm cache if needed:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```
